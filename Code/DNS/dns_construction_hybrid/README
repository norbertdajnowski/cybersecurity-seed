In Kaminsky attack, using Scapy to spoof packets is too slow, and 
the chance of success is almost zero. We can write a C program 
to do the spoofing, but to many students, this is quite hard. 
We can simply the task by leveraging both Scapy and C.

generate_dns_query.py:
generate_dns_reply.py:
-----------------------
   These Python programs generate a spoofed DNS packet using Scapy.
   The packet will be salved to a file 'ip.bin'

send_premade_dns.c
-----------------------
   This C program load the DNS packet from the file 'ip.bin', makes
   changes to some of the fields of the packet, and then use the raw
   socket to send the spoofed packet out.
